    <p>
        Your study protocol entitled "{{ $protocol->title }}" registered under number {{ $protocol->pct_id }} has its
        anticipated completion date passed.
    </p>
    <p>
        To ensure the accuracy of the information provided in your protocol, could you please update it on the platform and
        modify the following items to indicate:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The current state of the study (item 6) and add a URL or DOI to the corresponding research product/publication
            if available.</li>
        <li>If your study is not yet completed, please change your expected end date to a more plausible date (item 5).</li>
        <li>Provide links to datasets/raw data in item 26 that you deposited elsewhere (e.g., Datashare, Zenodo, Figshare,
            Open Science Framework, GitHub).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p style='background-color:#FFC5AF;padding:5px'>
        If you have unpublished results, we highly recommend you submit them on the <a
            href='https://www.fc3r.com/en/FC3R-short-notes.php'><strong>FC3R Short Note website</strong></a> â€“ a
        peer-reviewed platform disseminating unpublished results. You'll get the same recognition as a peer-reviewed
        journal. You can add the resulting DOI to your Preclinicaltrials.eu's protocol in item 26.
    </p>
    <p>
        Adding this information to your protocol <strong>increases transparency</strong> and <strong>reduces publication
            bias</strong>, by making your
        protocol and results/data easily accessible.
